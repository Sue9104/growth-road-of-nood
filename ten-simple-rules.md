| Reproducible computational research | developing public biological databases |  |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| For every result, keep track of how it was produced | dont reinvent the wheel |  |  |
| Avoid manual data manipulation | the most import thing is data quality |  |  |
| archive the exact versions of all external programs | know your audience: web interface, ftp, api |  |  |
| version control all custom scripts | use modern technology |  |  |
| record all intermediate results, when possible in standardized formats | put yourself in user's shoes: user-friendly |  |  |
| for analyses that include randomness, note underlying random seeds |  |  |  |
| always store raw behind plots |  |  |  |
| generate hierarchical analysis output, allowing layers of increasing detail to be inspected |  |  |  |
| connect textual statements to underlying results |  |  |  |
| provide public access to scripts, runs and results |  |  |  |
